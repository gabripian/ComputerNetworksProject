This project is a C client-server application to manage a restaurant service.
The application has a server which allows users to reserve a table in a restaurant.
The restaurant has a table device for each table, in which clients can order food from the menu and send the order directly to the kitchen.
The kitchen of the restaurant has some kitchen devices, with them chefs can see the orders from the clients, accept them and set the progress state during the preparation of the dishes.
The application has a client too, with it customers can interact with the server to reserve a table.
